In this part of the two part project I have interrogated the github api and used html to display some basic info.

I have added 3 buttons to my page and when you click each button there is some basic data displayed

The data for the Repos and issues simply display the name of the repo and the title of the issue respectively. 

The commits button shows the commit message along with the author's avatar

I will build on this and add some nice visualisation for the second part of the assignment.
